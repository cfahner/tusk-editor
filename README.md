# Tusk Editor

Goals:
* Run on all Linux desktops
* Auto-detect the project context when opening a file (for example, find the nearest git root or find the `composer.json` file for PHP projects and assume that's the project root).
* Don't polute the working directory
* Don't have too many integrated tools, just a file/text/code editor and do that well (not building a whole "studio")
* Support language server protocol
