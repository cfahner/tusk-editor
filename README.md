# Tusk Editor

Goals:
* Run on Linux desktops
* Support language server protocol
* Auto-detect the project context when opening a file (find a `.git` folder or a `composer.json` file for example)
* Don't pollute the working directory
* Not building a whole studio - assume debugging, building, linting, etc. is done using external tools
* No AI integrations since it angers the gods
